# NextJS Portfolio

This is the third iteration of my portfolio website. Based off the design from my first iteration that was created using HTML & CSS and JavaScript. The UI components design are based off my second iteration of the website that was created using ReactJS. 

Using the previous version I redesign into this new version and using the a new technology, **NextJS**, to build this version. For an easier update and maintenance of data when the record changes using **MongoDB** for the database to store information about my bio, projects, and experiences. In additional using **Vercel** for the built-in CI/CD.
