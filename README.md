# NextJS Portfolio

This is the third iteration of my portfolio website. Based off the design from my first iteration that was created using HTML & CSS and JavaScript. The UI components design are based off my second iteration of the website that was created using ReactJS. I combined these components both into a new version and also using a new technology which is NextJS to build this current version.
