# NextJS Portfolio

This is the third iteration of my portfolio website. Based off the design from my first iteration that was created using HTML & CSS and JavaScript. The UI components design are based off my second iteration of the website that was created using ReactJS. 

Using the previous version I redesign into this new version and also using  **NextJS** to build this version. Also added in **MongoDB** for the database to store information about my bio, projects, and experiences. For an easier update and maintenance of data when the record changes. Using **Vercel** for the built-in CI/CD when the UI design of the website changes to reflected without affecting user experiences.
